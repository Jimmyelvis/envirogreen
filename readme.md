# EnivroGreen Reality

This A very simple, fictional Real Estate site, complete with searching capabilities, and a small admin cms, which has full CRUD capabilities. The front-end is simply HTML/CSS using the BootStrap framework. And a small bit of JavaScript, mainly to handle the AJAX search, on the homepage. The back-end however was built using the Laravel 5 PHP framework, and uses a MySQL database. The Admin CMS allows users to create, update, and delete rental listings, as well as 
the same for staff.
