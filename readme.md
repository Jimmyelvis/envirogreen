# EnivroGreen Reality

This A very simple, fictional Real Estate site. The front-end is simply HTML/CSS using the BootStrap framework. And a small bit of JavaScript, mainly to handle the AJAX search, on the homepage. The back-end however was built using the Laravel 5 framework, and uses a MySQL database. This has enabled me to increase my knowledge of PHP while also learning the Laravel framework.
